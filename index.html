        <label for="title-1">Wrote my first mobile application</label>
        <p>
            Today I wrote my first mobile application. It was great! I had huge amounts of fun, it was
            a lot easier than I expected, and I was so happy I spent the rest of the day celebrating.

        <p>
            I am on such a roll with these mobile Web applications that I went crazy and wrote a second
            one. I am so happy I cannot stop singing at the top of my lungs. My cat seems worried that
            I've finally lost it completely, but I don't care â€” it's mobile Web all the way from now on!

        <label for="title-3">Must stop writing mobile applications</label>
        <p>
            My fingers are sore from writing so many great mobile Web applications. I know that I should
            stop and take a break, but there are so many great things to do with this technology that I
            really don't know how to stop!
